# CMPSC497-Midterm

Although this is a complex program, reproducing my results should be straightforwards. The first option is to simply open the given ipynb document in collab, and then use that to run the cells from top to bottom. This should easily reproduce my results. However, you should also be able to get similar results by installing all the dependencies and running the code in a local python enviornment. Please be aware that Tensorflow only works up to Python 3.11 at the moment (which is why I had to use collab for this project).
